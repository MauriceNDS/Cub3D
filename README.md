# Cub3d

The goal of ``cub3d`` is to make a graphic engine using raycasting (like [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D)).

* WASD to move
* Mantain SHIFT to crawl (it slows your speed, easier to awoid traps)
* ESC to quit
* Textures or colors for each sides (North, South, West, East) and Sky/Floor
* Multiple obstacle sprites that are configurable
* Animated sprites (heart, syringe)
* Secret doors (some wals are fake and lead to hidden rooms)
* Poisonous traps in form of mashrooms

## Goal
You spawn in a maze that can be configured (see example ``maps/game.cub``), all around the maze you will find toxic muchrooms planted by Teemo, whom you need to find.
The rest you shall explore by yourselves ^^
